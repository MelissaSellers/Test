<b>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1 rack pork baby back ribs<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;2 tablespoons Best Dry Rub for Ribs (See separate recipe)<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1 cup apple cider or apple juice<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1/4 cup dark brown sugar<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;2 - 3 tablespoons salted butter<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1/2 cup BBQ Sauce<br>
</b><br>
<br>
1)  Begin by removing the membrane on the back of the ribs.<br>
<br>
2)  Liberally season both sides of the ribs using the dry rub, starting with the bone side.<br>
<br>
3)  Prepare your smoker for indirect smoking. Target temperature is between 180-200 with thin blue smoke. <br>
Place the seasoned ribs on the smoker and close the lid. Leave them to smoke for 3 hours.<br>
<br>
4)  Tear off a large piece of aluminum foil and place it on a large working surface. <br>
Transfer the ribs to the foil bone side up so the bones don't tear through the foil. <br>
Sprinkle with the brown sugar, top with the butter cut into small pads, and then pour over the apple cider.<br>
<br>
5)  Tightly crimp the foil together to create an airtight seal. <br>
Return to the grill and increase your cooking temperature to as close to 225 degrees as you can get it. <br>
Let the ribs braise for 2 hours in the foil.<br>
<br>
6)  Carefully remove the ribs from the grill and place on a large working surface. <br>
Open the foil package (be careful of hot steam) and use tongs to remove the ribs and place them back on the grill, bone side down. <br>
Discard the foil and excess cooking liquid.<br>
<br>
7)  Brush the ribs with your favorite BBQ sauce, close the lid of your grill and cook at 225 degrees for an additional hour<br>
until the ribs are done to your desired tenderness and the sauce is sticky and set.<br><br>Recipe formatted with the <a href="http://www.dvo.com/index.html?CID=export_to_html_feature">Cook'n Recipe Software</a> from DVO Enterprises.<br>
