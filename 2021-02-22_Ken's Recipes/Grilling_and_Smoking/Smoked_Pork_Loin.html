&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;4 - 5 pounds pork loin roast<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1 tablespoon olive oil<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;2 - 3 tablespoons Hey Grill Hey Signature Sweet Rub (Dylan's favorite is Cajun Injector Cajun Shake Seasoning)<br>
</b><br>
<br>
Preheat your smoker to 225° F.<br>
<br>
Pat the pork loin roast dry with a paper towel. Trim any excess fat on the top that is over 1/4 inch thick.<br>
Use a really sharp knife to score through the fat cap - cut down about 1/4 of an inch in a diagonal pattern.<br>
<br>
Drizzle the pork loin on all sides with olive oil, and rub with your hands to ensure it's evenly coated. <br>
Sprinkle on all sides with Hey Grill Hey Sweet Rub. You can be a bit aggressive with the sweet rub, so ensure it is nice and coated.<br>
<br>
Place the pork loin directly on the grill grates of your smoker. Close the lid and smoke for 2 to 2 1/2 hours. <br>
It can take up to 3 hours to fully cook this pork depending on the thickness of the meat. <br>
Cook the pork until the internal temperature reaches 145° F.<br>
<br>
Remove the roast from the smoker. Tent with foil. Allow to rest for 10-15 minutes, then slice against the grain and serve.<br><br>Recipe formatted with the <a href="http://www.dvo.com/index.html?CID=export_to_html_feature">Cook'n Recipe Software</a> from DVO Enterprises.<br>
