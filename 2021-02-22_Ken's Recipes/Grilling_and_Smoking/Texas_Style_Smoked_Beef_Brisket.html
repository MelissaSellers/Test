<b>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;12 - 14 pounds whole packer beef brisket<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;2 tablespoons coarse kosher salt<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;2 tablespoons coarse ground black pepper<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;2 tablespoons garlic powder<br>
</b><br>
<br>
1)  Store your brisket in the refrigerator until you are ready to start trimming. Cold briskets are much easier to work with. <br>
Flip your brisket over so the point end is underneath. Remove any silver skin or excess fat from the flat muscle. <br>
Trim down the large crescent moon shaped fat section until it is a smooth transition between the point and the flat. <br>
Trim and excessive or loose meat and fat from the point. Square the edges and ends of the flat. <br>
Flip the brisket over and trim the top fat cap to about 1/4 of an inch thickness across the surface of the brisket.<br>
<br>
2)  In a mixing bowl or empty spice container, mix the salt, pepper, and garlic. Share over the brisket to evenly distribute the spices on all sides.<br>
<br>
3)  Preheat your smoker to 225° F using indirect heat and hardwood smoke. <br>
Place the brisket on the smoker with the point end facing your main heat source. <br>
This is a thicker part of the brisket and it can handle the additional heat. <br>
Close the lid and smoke until and internal thermometer reads 165° F (usually takes around 8 hours).<br>
<br>
4)  On a large work surface, roll out a big piece of butcher paper (or foil) and center your brisket in the middle.<br>
Wrap the brisket by folding edge over edge, creating a leak proof seal all the way around. <br>
Return the wrapped brisket to the smoker, seam side down so the weight from the brisket crimps the edges of the paper wrap down tight.<br>
<br>
5)  Close the lid on the smoker and, maintaining 225° F, continue cooking until the internal temperature of the brisket reaches 202° F in the thickest part of the meat (takes anywhere from 5-8 hours).<br>
<br>
6)  Remove the brisket to a large cutting board and allow to rest for 1 hour before slicing. <br>
<br>
7)  Slice both the point and the flat against the grain with a sharp knife and serve immediately.<br><br>Recipe formatted with the <a href="http://www.dvo.com/index.html?CID=export_to_html_feature">Cook'n Grocery List Software</a> from DVO Enterprises.<br>
